* JavaZone 2018 lightning talk - The Beauty and Elegance of testing in Kotlin

This year I had my first lightning talk at JavaZone! Here is the source for the slides, link to image creators and other information I may like to add. This way you can go through the slides for yourself if you thought it was interesting. 


** Watch it!
The video is finally out on Vimeo now! ..but there is one problem... There were technical issues, so the first few seconds are lost. I will try to recap the seconds in the next subsection. I don't want anyone hating on the JavaZone crew because of this!!!! They have been amazing and accommodating, and they tried their best to find the missing seconds. They were also very open on adding additional slides at the beginning if needed. Technical problems happen, all people who work in an IT field experience that from time to time... I hope you still get something out of my presentation :smile: Remember, have fun with programming in Kotlin! 


*** What was lost
The first slide was lost. It would look something like this (clone the project and open index.html in your browser for better quality! the colors look weird in this gif):
[[./introslide.gif]]


In this slide i simply say:
"Hello, and welcome to The Beauty and Elegance of testing in Kotlin! My name is Marie Katrine Ekeberg, and I work as a developer at Evry". 


The next slide is not lost, but some things I say are lost from it. I probably said something roughly like this:
"Do you enjoy writing tests? When was the last time you wrote a test? Did it turn into a whole mess of object initialization and messy code? ..."
(or something along the lines of that.

My changes to Webslides code can be used by any if you want to. The content of the presentation is mine, but you may use it if you feel it is useful. If you use bigger portions, then I would be happy if you linked to this github repo. 

** Image acknowledgments 
All the images used are either public domain or logo for a programming language (take a guess). The creators and sources of the images are given below. I have downloaded all of them into this project only to be able to present without internet (because internet connections can be shaky). I do NOT present myself as the creator of these images.
